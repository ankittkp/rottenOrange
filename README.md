# rottenOrange

Not gonna lie, I don't like oranges now for sure HaaHaaa...

The issue I was facing to calculate time for all process oranges for each unit of time. 

The answer was to loop my rotten orange in the queue each time we got orange to process or maintain the size of the queue length and compare the time with the time of the next rotten orange.


Note to self : Improve verbal communication, solve good questions, stay in touch.
